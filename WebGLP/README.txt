For my prototype, I am trying to make a maze game, similar to the Roll-A-Ball activity we did. There is a big maze, and the player must navigate the maze to find the 4 keys that unlock the exit. Right now, I have a fixed camera angle similar to Roll-A-Ball, but in the future, I want to have a camera that the user controls with the mouse and make it more of a close third-person maze to make it challenging to the player. I am also having difficulty connecting the goal object to display the "You Win!" text, but I have a decent amount for the first draft of my prototype.
